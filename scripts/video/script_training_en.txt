Welcome to the IslaPOS training module. This guide will help your team master the system quickly and efficiently.

Let's start with the basics. When you first open IslaPOS, you'll see the main menu screen with all available categories.

To create a new order, simply tap the items your customer wants. Each tap adds the item to the current order.

Need to modify an item? Tap it in the order summary to adjust quantity or add special requests like "no onions" or "extra sauce".

Managing multiple orders is easy. The system keeps track of table numbers or order names to prevent confusion.

When it's time to process payment, select the payment method. The system will calculate change automatically for cash payments.

At the end of each shift, you can generate reports to review sales performance and inventory levels.

If you encounter any issues, the help menu provides quick answers to common questions.

Practice makes perfect. Spend time exploring each feature to become confident with the system.

Thank you for completing this training. You're now ready to use IslaPOS effectively.
